CrouchJump

Change the F2 keybinding to whatever secomdary key you have set as jump Change E to whatever your crouch key is or just change your keys in game to match the script This will allow you to crouch jump in Playerunknown Battlegrounds without having to use gaming software like Logitech etc

Just to clarify You must setup a secondary jump key in-game (Example in this case is F2) and set that in the first field in the { } brackets Then set the second { } brackets to whatever your current crouch keybind is.
