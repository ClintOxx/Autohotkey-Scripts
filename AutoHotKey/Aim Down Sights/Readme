This folder contains two slightly different scripts for aiming down sights(ADS) in PUBG by just pressing and holding right click. 

One will auto hold shift for you so it can hold your breath, the other wont. 

Just download and click run and they will work. 

You will need AHK and you use the Home key to pause the script.
