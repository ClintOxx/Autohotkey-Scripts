This is a script that will move your character forward and jump out the plane at an random range. 

You will have to use this with another bot , it is not a stand alone bot meant to be used by itself. 

The rand sleep time denotes what range of time the bot will jump out the plane 

The sleep time inside the loop for pressing W will let you know how long that key will be pressed for. it will run 5 times on default until it moves to the next phase. 

The next phase is for the script to rest long enough for you to exit the game and get through the main menu and waiting lobby. The values I have in there should auto sync up with the python bot .
